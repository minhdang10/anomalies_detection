### Tech Stack: Python, Snowflake, PowerBI

##### PURPOSE #####
This project identify anomalies in at different stages of shipping procedures and/or about the packages themselves. 

##### DESCRIPTION #####
With Prophet library in Python and SQL queries from SendTech databases from Snowflake, this project detects anomalies using time series regression modeling in terms of measurements of packages (masses, dimensions, densities, volumes) and number of processed parcels within a specific time frame across US facilities. Various metrics were used to evaluate the model and to alert and interact with clients regarding timely reported anomalies on the interactive dashboard
